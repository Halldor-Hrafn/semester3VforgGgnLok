Welcome to this amazing super duper project of amazingness that will be my biggest project to date. The one who will be making this project will be the amazing Mrpotts and will have a bunch of functionality

*NOTE*
- the 'models' folder is used with faunadb
  - faunadb is in the experimental stage

The packages used in this project are:
- express: for the backend 
- argon2: to hash passwords
- dotenv: to acces environment variables with nodejs
- better-sqlite3: as the database paradigm
- faunadb: as an experiment to see how a document/relational database paradigm works

What the project will have:
- user signup/login/logout system
- a forum post area
- a todo list
- uploading/downloading system

What I am working on:
- CRUD operations using better-sqlite3
- eperimental CRUD operations with faunadb

What I want to have in this project:
- Faunadb
  - because it can work as both a relational and document database
